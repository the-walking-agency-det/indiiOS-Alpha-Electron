# Security Hardening Report: Project indiiOS

**Date:** December 7, 2025
**Status:** Commercial Grade Hardening Complete
**Audience:** key stakeholders, security auditors, development team

## 1. Executive Summary

This report documents the comprehensive security hardening applied to the Rndr-AI-v1 Electron application. The objective was to transition the application from a standard development posture to a "Commercial Grade" Secure Vault, specifically addressing vulnerabilities identified in the **HEY Security Audit** and the **Pixel Thief** research paper.

All critical kill chains (RCE, Data Theft, Network MitM, Tampering) have been neutralized through a defense-in-depth architecture. The application binary is now locked, signed, and obfuscated, ready for production distribution.

## 2. Vulnerability Remediation Matrix

The following table maps specific security audit findings to the implemented technical controls.

| Vulnerability Class | Audit Ref | Risk Level | Implemented Control | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hard-coded Credentials** | HEY #2 | High | **PKCE Auth Flow & deep linking:** Removed static secrets; switched to dynamic code exchange. | ✅ Fixed |
| **Missing Cert Pinning** | HEY #3 | Medium | **SSL/TLS Pinning:** Main process enforces strict public key pinning for API domains. | ✅ Fixed |
| **Information Exposure** | HEY #9 | High | **Visual Privacy:** Enabled `setContentProtection(true)` to block OS screenshots/recording. | ✅ Fixed |
| **Insecure Storage** | HEY #10 | High | **Encrypted Vault:** User data encrypted with AES-256 (key derived from token). Tokens in System Keychain (`keytar`). | ✅ Fixed |
| **Insecure Updates** | HEY #12 | Critical | **Signed Auto-Update:** Enforced strict signature verification for all updates. | ✅ Fixed |
| **Debug Port Exposure** | HEY #15 | Critical | **Electron Fuses:** Permanently disabled `--inspect`, `NODE_OPTIONS`, and `RunAsNode` capabilities. | ✅ Fixed |
| **Context Isolation** | HEY #17 | Critical | **Strict Isolation:** `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`, `sandbox: true`. | ✅ Fixed |
| **Permission Granting** | HEY #18 | Medium | **Permission Lockdown:** Default-deny policy for Camera, Mic, Geolocation, and HID. | ✅ Fixed |
| **Arbitrary Navigation** | HEY #20 | High | **Navigation Lock:** `will-navigate` and `setWindowOpenHandler` restrict external URLs. | ✅ Fixed |
| **Reverse Engineering** | Appx D | Medium | **Obfuscation:** Integrated `webpack-obfuscator` for production builds. | ✅ Fixed |
| **Pixel Thief (Side-Channel)** | Research | High | **Cross-Origin Isolation:** COOP (`same-origin-allow-popups`) + COEP (`require-corp`). | ✅ Fixed |
| **Tampering** | General | High | **ASAR Integrity:** Enforced binary integrity checks at startup. | ✅ Fixed |

## 3. Technical Implementation Details

### 3.1 Binary & Runtime Security

* **Electron Fuses:** The application binary is "fused" at build time using `@electron/fuses`. This disables Node.js CLI arguments, specifically preventing attackers from attaching debuggers or injecting code via environment variables.
* **ASAR Integrity:** The application bundle (`app.asar`) is read-only and integrity-checked. Any modification to the source code files on disk will cause the application to refuse startup.
* **Visual Privacy:** The `setContentProtection(true)` flag is active, preventing the OS from generating thumbnails for the task switcher and blocking screen capture tools (stopping malware and accidental sharing).

### 3.2 Network Security

* **Certificate Pinning:** The Main Process intercepts all certificate validation requests. Connections to critical APIs (`api.indii.os`) are only allowed if the server's public key fingerprint matches our hardcoded allowlist.
* **Secure Deep Linking:** The legacy `localhost` redirect web server has been removed. Authentication now uses a custom protocol scheme (`indii-os://`), which is validated to prevent Argument Injection attacks.
* **CSP & COOP/COEP:** strict Content Security Policy forbids `unsafe-eval` in production. Cross-Origin Opener Policy (COOP) and Cross-Origin Embedder Policy (COEP) isolate the process memory, mitigating Spectre and "Pixel Thief" attacks.

### 3.3 Data Security

* **Secure Storage Architecture:**
  * **Tokens:** Stored exclusively in the Operating System's Key Store (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Vault) via `keytar`.
  * **Local Data:** All local database files are encrypted using AES-256 (via `electron-store` with encryption). The encryption key is derived dynamically and never stored in plain text.
* **Code Obfuscation:** The production build pipeline now includes `webpack-obfuscator`, rendering the JavaScript source code unintelligible to static analysis tools.

### 3.4 Renderer Hardening

* **Drag-and-Drop Block:** Global event listeners in the Renderer process prevent users from accidentally dragging files into the window, which could otherwise trigger unhandled navigation or code execution.
* **Iframe Sandboxing:** All external content must be loaded in `<iframe>` elements with the `sandbox` attribute strictly configured (no top-navigation, no same-origin).

## 4. Files Modified & Created

* **`electron/main.ts`**: Implemented Fuses, Pinning, Permission Handlers, Deep Linking, and Security Headers.
* **`electron/preload.ts`**: Configured secure Context Bridge.
* **`electron/services/AuthStorage.ts`**: implemented `keytar` logic.
* **`electron/services/SecureStore.ts`**: Implemented encrypted `electron-store` logic.
* **`forge.config.js`**: Added `FusesPlugin` and ASAR integrity configuration.
* **`vite.config.ts`**: Added `webpack-obfuscator` for production builds.
* **`package.json`**: Added security dependencies (`helmet`, `dompurify`, `keytar`, etc.) and locked versions.
* **`src/main.tsx`**: Added global drag-and-drop prevention.

## 5. Maintenance Procedures

To maintain this security posture, the following actions are required:

1. **Weekly:** Run `npm audit` to identify and patch vulnerability upstream dependencies.
2. **Annually:**
    * Rotate the Code Signing Certificate used in `forge.config.js`.
    * Review and update the Pinned Certificate Fingerprints in `electron/main.ts` before they expire.
3. **On Update:** Monitor Electron release notes for new security features or Fuse definitions.
