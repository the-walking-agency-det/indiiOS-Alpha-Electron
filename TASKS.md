## Current App State (Dec 25, 2025)

### Working Features

- **Electron Desktop App**: Packaged and running on macOS (arm64)
- **Google OAuth Flow**: Full deep link auth working via `indii-os://` protocol
- **Login Bridge**: Deployed at `https://indiios-v-1-1.web.app/login-bridge`
- **Firebase Auth**: signInWithCredential using Google OAuth tokens
- **IPC Communication**: Secure preload bridge between main/renderer
- **All 15 Agents**: Registered and operational (Marketing, Legal, Finance, Producer, Music, Director, Screenwriter, Video, Social, Publicist, Road, Publishing, Licensing, Brand, Generalist)
- **Unit Tests**: 42 passing (MembershipService + CleanupService)

### Auth Flow Architecture

```text
Electron App → Login Bridge (browser) → Google OAuth → Deep Link → IPC → Firebase Auth
                                         ↓
                              GoogleAuthProvider.credentialFromResult()
                                         ↓
                              indii-os://auth/callback?idToken=...&accessToken=...
                                         ↓
                              signInWithCredential(auth, credential)
```

| `src/services/AuthService.ts` | Electron detection, ELECTRON_AUTH_PENDING flow |
| `src/modules/auth/Login.tsx` | Handle ELECTRON_AUTH_PENDING, fixed SVG path |
| `electron/handlers/auth.ts` | Deep link parsing with token logging |
| `forge.config.cjs` | URL scheme `indii-os://` protocol registration |

### Known Issues (Non-Blocking)

- GPU process crash on app close (cosmetic, `exit_code=15`)
- Network service restart on close (cosmetic)
