# indiiOS Improvement Roadmap

This document tracks the implementation of technical improvements and architectural upgrades.

## Phase 1: Architecture & Foundation

- [x] **State Management**: Refactored to Zustand with modular slices (`authSlice`, `appSlice`, `creativeSlice`).
- [x] **Robust Initialization**: Implemented `initializeAuth` and `loadProjects` in `App.tsx` for reliable startup.
- [x] **Multi-Tenancy**: Implemented Organization/Project hierarchy and context switching.

## Phase 2: User Experience (Feedback Loop)

- [x] **Toast System**: Implemented notification service with success, error, info, warning, and loading toast types. Includes progress tracking and promise-based API.
- [x] **Integration**: Replaced silent operations with Toast feedback across Creative Studio, Showroom, and other modules.

## Phase 3: Data Integrity & Safety

- [x] **ZIP Export**: Implemented full project export with `ExportService` (assets + metadata JSON). Includes progress tracking via Toast system.
- [x] **Cloud Sync**: Multi-device sync via Firestore + Firebase Storage. Offline persistence enabled automatically.
- [x] **Database Vacuum**: Implemented `CleanupService` with dry-run scan and confirm-before-delete workflow. Accessible via Dashboard "Cleanup" button.

## Phase 4: AI Hardening

- [x] **Tool Validation**: Implement strict schema validation for Agent tool outputs.
- [x] **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Implement Hub-and-Spoke model with specialized agents.
- [x] **Specialist Agents**: Added Road Manager, Brand Manager, and Legal Advisor.
- [x] **Semantic Memory**: Implemented via `MemoryService` with vector embeddings. `ContextPipeline` auto-retrieves relevant memories and `BaseAgent` injects them into prompts.

## Phase 5: UI Polish

- [x] **Mobile Density**: Refactored "Studio Mode" tabs and Navbar for mobile responsiveness.
- [x] **Landing Page**: Implemented "Liquid Orbs" and "Data Vault" visuals.

## Phase 6: Stability & Scale (Current Focus)

- [x] **Stress Testing**: Rendering performance validated (38+ fps, 0 frame drops). Auth-dependent tests require Firebase emulator setup.
- [x] **E2E Testing**: Implement Playwright flows for critical paths.
- [x] **Backend Migration**: Migrated Image Generation and heavy tasks to Firebase Functions.

## Phase 7: New Capabilities

- [x] **Road Manager**: Logistics and itinerary planning.
- [x] **Brand Manager**: Brand consistency and asset generation.
- [x] **Voice Control**: Speech-to-text input via `VoiceService` and CommandBar mic button. Text-to-speech output in ChatOverlay.
