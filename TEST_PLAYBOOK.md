# 🧪 Rndr AI Test Playbook

This document defines the named stress test protocols used to validate Rndr AI. Use these names to quickly trigger specific testing scenarios.

## 1. The Gauntlet 🛡️

**Scope:** New User Onboarding & Critical Path  
**File:** `e2e/stress-test-new-user.spec.ts`

"The Gauntlet" simulates a brand new user going through the entire "Happy Path" at speed. It verifies that the core value loop is unbroken.

- **Scenarios:**
  - **The Speedrun**: Full onboarding -> Project Creation -> Agent Interaction.
  - **The Chaos Check**: Rapid navigation between modules to check for memory leaks/unmount crashes.
- **Command:**

  ```bash
  npx playwright test e2e/stress-test-new-user.spec.ts
  ```

## 2. Fear Factor 😱

**Scope:** Chaos Engineering & Resilience  
**File:** `e2e/fear-factor.spec.ts`

"Fear Factor" injects failures into the environment to test application resilience. It ensures the "Shell" (Sidebar/Nav) survives even when content modules crash.

- **Scenarios:**
  - **The Network Nightmare**: Simulates 20% request failure (500s) and high latency (3s). Verifies app doesn't white-screen.
  - **The Click Frenzy**: Randomized input flooding (Monkey Testing) to catch race conditions.
  - **The Double Agent**: (Planned) Concurrent, conflicting edits from multiple agents.
- **Command:**

  ```bash
  npx playwright test e2e/fear-factor.spec.ts
  ```

## 3. Flash Mob ⚡

**Scope:** High Concurrency & Load  
**File:** `e2e/load-simulation.spec.ts`

"Flash Mob" spawns multiple concurrent virtual users (VUs) to hammer the backend simultaneously. It tests quotas, rate limits (`429`), and frontend state stability.

- **Configuration:** Defaults to 20 Concurrent Users.
- **Pass Criteria:** App must not crash; at least 50% of requests must succeed even under load.
- **Command:**

  ```bash
  npx playwright test e2e/load-simulation.spec.ts --workers=10
  ```

## 4. The Nomad 🐫

**Scope:** Cross-Platform Continuity  
**File:** `e2e/cross-platform.spec.ts`

"The Nomad" verifies the data persistence and synchronization workflow across different devices. It simulates a user switching contexts by transferring Authentication State.

- **Flow:**
  1. **Electron (Desktop)**: Login -> Create Project -> Save Work.
  2. **Mobile (iPhone)**: Login (Session Transfer) -> Verify Work Exists -> Make Edit.
  3. **Cloud (Web)**: Login -> Verify Mobile Edit appears.
- **Command:**

  ```bash
  npx playwright test e2e/cross-platform.spec.ts
  ```

## 5. The Librarian 📚

**Scope:** RAG, Knowledge Base, & File Processing  
**Status:** Planned  
**File:** `e2e/the-librarian.spec.ts`

"The Librarian" validates the entire Intelligence Pipeline using **REAL DATA**.

1. **Ingest**: Uploads a unique "Test Manifesto" text file to the Knowledge Base.
2. **Index**: Waits for the backend to vector-embed the document (Real Cloud Function).
3. **Retrieve**: Asks the Agent a question *only* answerable by that document.
4. **Verify**: Ensures the Agent quotes the document. **NO MOCKS.**

---

## 6. The Paparazzi 📸

**Scope:** Media, Storage, & Generation  
**Status:** Planned  
**File:** `e2e/the-paparazzi.spec.ts`

"The Paparazzi" tests the heavy media pipelines.

1. **Shoot**: Uploads a real image file to Storage.
2. **Process**: Triggers the AI Vision analysis.
3. **Print**: Requests an image generation based on the analysis.
4. **Gallery**: Verifies the generated image URL is valid and publicly accessible.

---

## 7. The Time Traveler ⏳

**Scope:** Data Integrity, Undo/Redo, Persistence  
**Status:** Planned  
**File:** `e2e/time-traveler.spec.ts`

"The Time Traveler" ensures that what we write to the database *actually stays there* and implies correct ordering.

1. **The Timeline**: Creates a Project, adds 5 distinct items (history events).
2. **The Jump**: Reloads the page (clears local state).
3. **The Paradox**: Verifies all 5 items load in the correct order.
4. **The Correction**: Deletes item #3. Reloads. Verifies #3 is gone but #1, #2, #4, #5 remain.

---

## 8. The Gatekeeper 🔐

**Scope:** Authentication & Onboarding  
**Status:** Ready  
**File:** `e2e/auth-flow.spec.ts`

"The Gatekeeper" verifies the Authentication System, ensuring the critical bridge between the Landing Page and the Studio App is secure and functional.

- **Scenarios:**
  - **The Initiate**: New User Signup on Landing Page.
  - **The Return**: Existing User Login.
  - **The Border**: Verifies automatic redirects for unauthenticated users trying to access the Studio.
- **Command:**

  ```bash
  npx playwright test e2e/auth-flow.spec.ts
  ```

## 9. The Bouncer 🦍

**Scope:** Landing Page UI Logic
**Components:** `landing-page/app/page.tsx`
**File:** `landing-page/app/TheBouncer.test.tsx`

"The Bouncer" checks the front door. It ensures that the Landing Page recognizes VIPs (authenticated users) and rolls out the "Launch Studio" carpet, while directing guests to the "Sign In" line.

- **Scenarios:**
  - **The Guest**: Unauthenticated user sees "Sign In" / "Get Started".
  - **The VIP**: Authenticated user sees "Launch Studio".

- **Command:**

  ```bash
  cd landing-page && npx vitest run app/TheBouncer.test.tsx
  ```

## 10. The Architect 📐

**Scope:** `src/modules/workflow` (Node Editor Logic)
**Status:** Planned
**File:** `src/modules/workflow/TheArchitect.test.tsx`

"The Architect" verifies the structural integrity of the Workflow Engine. It ensures that nodes connect correctly, data flows downstream, and invalid connections are rejected.

- **Scenarios:**
  - **The Blueprint**: Create a valid workflow (Trigger -> Action -> Output).
  - **The Structural Failure**: Connect incompatible types and verify validation error.

---

## 11. The Director 🎬

**Scope:** `src/modules/video` (Video Editor State)
**Status:** Planned
**File:** `src/modules/video/TheDirector.test.tsx`

"The Director" puts the Video Editor through a stress test. It manages the timeline, clips, and ensures that the edit decision list (EDL) remains stable under rapid changes.

- **Scenarios:**
  - **The Rough Cut**: Add clips to timeline -> Reorder them.
  - **The Undo/Redo**: Perform edits and revert them, verifying state integrity.

---

## 12. The Anarchist Ⓐ

**Scope:** `src/modules/video` (Chaos & Error Handling)
**Status:** Planned
**File:** `src/modules/video/TheAnarchist.test.tsx`

"The Anarchist" attempts to break the system by ignoring rules, injecting chaos, and simulating state corruption.

- **Scenarios:**
  - **The Riot (Input Chaos)**: Inject wildly invalid data (NaN, Infinity, Negative numbers) into Store actions. Verify graceful handling.
  - **The Squatter (Permission Defiance)**: Attempt to modify non-existent (or "unowned") resources.
  - **The Mutiny (State Rebellion)**: Force the store into impossible states (e.g. `completed` status without result data) and verify UI resilience.
