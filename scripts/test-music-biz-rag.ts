MUSICIAN'S GUIDE TO ROYALTIES

1. MECHANICAL ROYALTIES
These are paid to songwriters whenever a copy of their song is made (e.g., streamed, downloaded, or manufactured on CD/Vinyl). In the US, the statutory rate is set by the CRB.

2. PERFORMANCE ROYALTIES
These are paid when a song is performed publicly. This includes radio airplay, streaming (Spotify, Apple Music), live venues, and restaurants. These are collected by PROs like ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC.

3. SOUND RECORDING ROYALTIES
These are paid to the master rights holder (usually the label) and the performing artist. For digital performance (like Pandora or SiriusXM), these are collected by SoundExchange.
